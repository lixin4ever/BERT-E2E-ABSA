Deploy the model on Anvil 

# We also need to have few changes in python file to run anvil code

Anvil Code:

from ._anvil_designer import Form1Template
from anvil import *
import anvil.server


class Form1(Form1Template):
  def __init__(self, **properties):
    # Set Form properties and Data Bindings.
    self.init_components(**properties)
    
    
  def outlined_button_1_click(self, **event_args):
    
      """This method is called when the button is clicked"""
      Sentiment_score = anvil.server.call('sentiment', self.sentence.text)
      if Sentiment_score :
            self.label.visible = True
            self.label.text = "Result : ", Sentiment_scoret.capitalize()
      

  def rich_text_4_show(self, **event_args):
      """This method is called when the RichText is shown on the screen"""
      pass
