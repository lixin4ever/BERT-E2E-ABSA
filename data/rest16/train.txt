The food is very good, but not outstanding.####The=O food=T-NEU is=O very=O good=O ,=O but=O not=O outstanding=O .=O

Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.####Mistakes=O happen=O ,=O but=O they=O are=O usually=O accompanied=O by=O an=O apology=O ,=O perhaps=O even=O a=O glass=O of=O winebut=O not=O the=O grunt=O that=O we=O received=O from=O the=O Al=O Di=O La=O staff=T-NEG .=O
Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.####Without=O the=O wait=O or=O attitude=O ,=O I=O would=O probably=O go=O back=O ,=O but=O there=O are=O just=O too=O many=O other=O restaurants=O in=O Brooklyn=O that=O are=O as=O good=O or=O better=O and=O do=O n't=O make=O me=O jump=O through=O hoops=O .=O
