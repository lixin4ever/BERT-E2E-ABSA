There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. ####There=O 's=O another=O girl=T-NEG who=O I=O ca=O n't=O describe=O ,=O she=O is=O about=O 5'6=O with=O brown=O hair=O ,=O who=O eavesdrops=O on=O your=O conversation=O and=O chimes=O in=O ,=O except=O she=O only=O hears=O the=O last=O part=O of=O what=O you=O said=O ,=O so=O her=O uninvited=O opinions=O are=O often=O out=O of=O context=O and=O nothing=O to=O do=O with=O what=O you=O 're=O *really*=O talking=O about=O .=O
